# Sequential Thinking Context Enhancement

## Date
March 31, 2025

## Changes Made

I've enhanced the `sequential-thinking` server by adding support for automatically gathering and including relevant code context when sending prompts to Claude. The following components were implemented:

1. Modified the `callClaudeAPI` function to accept and incorporate additional context parameters:
   - `filePaths`: List of relevant file paths to include in the prompt
   - `directoryNames`: List of relevant directory names to include in the prompt
   - `codeSnippets`: Code snippets to include in the prompt for deeper context

2. Added a `gatherRelevantContext` method to dynamically identify relevant code files based on the current thought:
   - Analyzes thought text to extract keywords
   - Maps keywords to relevant files in the codebase
   - Always includes core files like `index.ts` and `types.ts`
   - Adds specific files based on detected concepts (e.g., if "visualization" is mentioned, includes `visualization.ts`)

3. Added an `extractKeywords` helper method to process thought text:
   - Filters out common stop words
   - Returns unique keywords for context matching

4. Updated the `processThought` method to use the new context-gathering capabilities:
   - Calls `gatherRelevantContext` before each LLM call
   - Passes the gathered context to all `callClaudeAPI` invocations

## Benefits

This enhancement provides several key benefits:

1. **Improved context awareness**: Claude now receives relevant code snippets and file paths along with the thought text, enabling more accurate and technically relevant responses.

2. **Dynamic context selection**: The context is tailored to each thought, providing only what's relevant to the current processing stage and thought content.

3. **Self-documenting responses**: The inclusion of file paths and directory names makes the Claude responses more aware of the codebase structure.

4. **Optimized token usage**: By selecting only the most relevant files and limiting the number and size of code snippets, the implementation maintains reasonable prompt sizes.

## Testing Notes

The code has been implemented and should now work when processing thoughts. The `gatherRelevantContext` method is called during each thought processing cycle, and the relevant context is included in each of the three API calls to Claude (analysis, synthesis, and evaluation).

Future enhancements might include:
- More sophisticated keyword extraction using NLP techniques
- Context caching to avoid repeated file reads
- Adding test coverage for the new methods
