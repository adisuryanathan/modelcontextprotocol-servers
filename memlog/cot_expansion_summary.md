# Chain of Thought Expansion Summary

## Overview
The sequential thinking server has been successfully expanded to include explicit Chain of Thought (CoT) functionality. This enhancement allows for more structured reasoning, hypothesis generation, and verification within the sequential thinking framework.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Chain of Thought Fields to ThoughtData Interface
- `isChainOfThought`: Boolean flag to mark a thought as part of a Chain of Thought sequence
- `isHypothesis`: Boolean flag to mark a thought as a hypothesis in the Chain of Thought
- `isVerification`: Boolean flag to mark a thought as verifying a hypothesis in the Chain of Thought
- `chainOfThoughtStep`: The step number in the Chain of Thought sequence
- `totalChainOfThoughtSteps`: The total number of steps in the Chain of Thought sequence

### 2. Updated Validation Function
- Modified the `validateThoughtData` function to handle the new Chain of Thought fields

### 3. Enhanced Formatting Function
- Updated the `formatThought` function to display Chain of Thought steps differently
- Added special formatting for hypothesis and verification steps
- Used different colors and icons to distinguish between different types of thoughts

### 4. Updated Response Data
- Modified the `processThought` method to include Chain of Thought specific fields in the response
- This allows clients to know about the Chain of Thought status

### 5. Updated Tool Description and Input Schema
- Enhanced the tool description to emphasize the Chain of Thought approach
- Added documentation for the new Chain of Thought fields
- Updated the input schema to include the new Chain of Thought fields

### 6. Incremented Server Version
- Updated the server version from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0 to reflect the Chain of Thought addition

### 7. Created Example Usage Script
- Added an `example-usage.js` script that demonstrates how to use the Chain of Thought functionality
- Included examples of regular thoughts, Chain of Thought steps, hypothesis generation, and verification

### 8. Added Comprehensive Documentation
- Created a detailed README.md file that explains the Chain of Thought functionality
- Included usage examples, parameter descriptions, and when to use the different features

## Benefits
- More structured reasoning process for complex problems
- Explicit support for hypothesis generation and verification
- Clearer visualization of the reasoning process
- Better support for step-by-step problem-solving

## Next Steps
- Test the expanded functionality with real-world problems
- Gather feedback from users
- Consider adding more Chain of Thought specific features in future versions
