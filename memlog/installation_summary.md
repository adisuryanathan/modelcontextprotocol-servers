# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Installation Summary

## Overview
The sequential thinking MCP server has been successfully built and installed in both VSCode and the Claude desktop app. This server provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential thoughts and chain of thought reasoning.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Built the Sequential Thinking Server
- Compiled the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the build script
- Generated the executable JavaScript file in the dist directory
- Verified that the build was successful

### 2. Installed the MCP Server in VSCode
- Updated the VSCode MCP settings configuration file at:
  `/Users/justincornelius/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- Added the sequential thinking server configuration with the path to the compiled JavaScript file

### 3. Installed the MCP Server in Claude Desktop App
- Updated the Claude desktop app configuration file at:
  `/Users/justincornelius/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Added the sequential thinking server configuration with the path to the compiled JavaScript file
- Cleaned up the configuration file to only include the sequential thinking MCP server

### 4. Created Testing Instructions
- Provided step-by-step instructions for testing the sequential thinking server
- Included example prompts for testing both regular sequential thinking and Chain of Thought functionality
- Described the expected results when the server is working correctly

## Next Steps
1. Restart VSCode and/or the Claude desktop app for the changes to take effect
2. Test the sequential thinking server using the provided example prompts
3. Explore the Chain of Thought functionality for complex problem-solving

## Benefits
- Enhanced problem-solving capabilities with sequential thinking
- Structured reasoning process with Chain of Thought
- Explicit support for hypothesis generation and verification
- Better visualization of the reasoning process
