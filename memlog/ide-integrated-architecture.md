# IDE-Integrated Gemini-Claude Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines a refined architecture for the Sequential Thinking tool that integrates Gemini directly into the IDE as the default AI, with Claude used only for specialized reasoning tasks in the cloud. This approach would maximize token efficiency and provide a seamless user experience.

## Proposed Architecture

```
User Input → Gemini (in IDE) → Claude (in cloud for reasoning) → Results → Gemini (in IDE for presentation)
```

In this architecture:

1. **Gemini as Default IDE AI**: Gemini would be integrated directly into the IDE and serve as the default AI for user interactions
2. **Local Context Awareness**: Gemini would have direct access to the file system, IDE state, and local context
3. **Selective Cloud Processing**: Only specialized reasoning tasks would be sent to Claude in the cloud
4. **Minimal Token Transfer**: Only essential, pre-processed information would be sent to Claude
5. **Local Result Presentation**: Results would be returned to Gemini in the IDE for presentation to the user

## Benefits

1. **Maximum Token Efficiency**: Claude would only see the minimal necessary information
2. **Reduced Latency**: Most operations would happen locally within the IDE
3. **Enhanced Context Awareness**: Gemini would have direct access to the IDE's file system and state
4. **Improved User Experience**: The user would interact with a single, consistent interface
5. **Specialized Task Division**: Each AI would handle the tasks it's best suited for

## Implementation Details

### 1. IDE Integration

Gemini would be integrated directly into the IDE through an extension or plugin:

```javascript
class GeminiIdeExtension {
  constructor() {
    this.gemini = new GeminiAI();
    this.fileSystem = new IdeFileSystemAccess();
    this.claudeClient = new CloudClaudeClient();
  }
  
  async processUserInput(input) {
    // 1. Process input locally with Gemini
    const localContext = await this.fileSystem.getRelevantContext(input);
    const geminiProcessed = await this.gemini.process(input, localContext);
    
    // 2. Determine if Claude processing is needed
    if (this.needsClaudeProcessing(geminiProcessed)) {
      // 3. Prepare minimal data for Claude
      const claudeInput = this.prepareForClaude(geminiProcessed);
      
      // 4. Send to Claude in the cloud
      const claudeResult = await this.claudeClient.process(claudeInput);
      
      // 5. Integrate Claude's results back into Gemini's context
      return this.gemini.integrateClaudeResults(claudeResult);
    }
    
    // If Claude processing not needed, return Gemini's results directly
    return geminiProcessed;
  }
  
  needsClaudeProcessing(geminiResult) {
    // Determine if the task requires Claude's specialized reasoning
    // For example, complex reasoning chains, creative tasks, etc.
    return geminiResult.complexityScore > 0.7 || 
           geminiResult.requiresAdvancedReasoning;
  }
  
  prepareForClaude(geminiResult) {
    // Create a minimal representation for Claude
    // This should be highly optimized to use as few tokens as possible
    return {
      essentialContext: geminiResult.essentialContext,
      queryType: geminiResult.queryType,
      specificQuestion: geminiResult.specificQuestion,
      relevantFactors: geminiResult.relevantFactors
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. File System Access

Gemini would have direct access to the IDE's file system:

```javascript
class IdeFileSystemAccess {
  async getRelevantContext(userInput) {
    // Analyze user input to determine what files/directories are relevant
    const relevantPaths = this.extractRelevantPaths(userInput);
    
    // Get file contents and directory structures
    const fileContents = await Promise.all(
      relevantPaths.files.map(async (file) => ({
        path: file,
        content: await this.readFile(file)
      }))
    );
    
    const directoryStructures = await Promise.all(
      relevantPaths.directories.map(async (dir) => ({
        path: dir,
        structure: await this.getDirectoryStructure(dir)
      }))
    );
    
    return {
      files: fileContents,
      directories: directoryStructures,
      workspaceRoot: this.getWorkspaceRoot(),
      openEditors: this.getOpenEditors()
    };
  }
  
  extractRelevantPaths(userInput) {
    // Extract file and directory paths mentioned in the user input
    // This could use NLP techniques to identify paths
    // ...
  }
  
  async readFile(path) {
    // Read file content directly from the IDE's file system
    // ...
  }
  
  async getDirectoryStructure(path) {
    // Get directory structure directly from the IDE's file system
    // ...
  }
  
  getWorkspaceRoot() {
    // Get the root directory of the current workspace
    // ...
  }
  
  getOpenEditors() {
    // Get information about currently open editor tabs
    // ...
  }
}
```

### 3. Cloud Claude Client

A client for communicating with Claude in the cloud:

```javascript
class CloudClaudeClient {
  constructor() {
    this.apiKey = process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY;
    this.endpoint = process.env.CLAUDE_ENDPOINT || 'https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages';
  }
  
  async process(input) {
    // Send the minimal, pre-processed input to Claude
    const response = await fetch(this.endpoint, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'x-api-key': this.apiKey,
        'anthropic-version': '2023-06-01'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
        max_tokens: 1000,
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'system',
            content: 'You are a reasoning assistant for the Sequential Thinking tool. Your job is to provide high-quality reasoning based on the minimal context provided.'
          },
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: JSON.stringify(input)
          }
        ]
      })
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    return this.parseClaudeResponse(result);
  }
  
  parseClaudeResponse(response) {
    // Parse Claude's response and extract the relevant information
    // ...
  }
}
```

### 4. Result Integration

Gemini would integrate Claude's results and present them to the user:

```javascript
class GeminiAI {
  async process(input, context) {
    // Process the user input with Gemini
    // ...
  }
  
  async integrateClaudeResults(claudeResults) {
    // Integrate Claude's results into Gemini's context
    // Format the results for presentation to the user
    return {
      response: this.formatResponse(claudeResults),
      suggestedActions: this.generateSuggestedActions(claudeResults),
      relevantFiles: this.identifyRelevantFiles(claudeResults)
    };
  }
  
  formatResponse(claudeResults) {
    // Format Claude's results for presentation to the user
    // ...
  }
  
  generateSuggestedActions(claudeResults) {
    // Generate suggested actions based on Claude's results
    // ...
  }
  
  identifyRelevantFiles(claudeResults) {
    // Identify relevant files based on Claude's results
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Integration with Sequential Thinking

This architecture would integrate with the Sequential Thinking tool as follows:

1. **Thought Processing**: Gemini would handle the initial processing of thoughts
2. **Context Management**: Gemini would maintain context between thoughts locally
3. **Specialized Reasoning**: Claude would be used only for specialized reasoning tasks
4. **Token Optimization**: Only minimal, pre-processed information would be sent to Claude
5. **Result Presentation**: Results would be presented to the user through Gemini in the IDE

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: IDE Integration (2-3 weeks)

1. Develop a VSCode extension that integrates Gemini
2. Implement file system access through the IDE's API
3. Create a basic UI for user interaction

### Phase 2: Cloud Integration (1-2 weeks)

1. Implement the Claude cloud client
2. Develop token optimization for cloud communication
3. Create result integration mechanisms

### Phase 3: Sequential Thinking Integration (2-3 weeks)

2. Implement thought processing and context management
3. Develop specialized reasoning delegation

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (1-2 weeks)

2. Optimize token usage and performance
3. Refine the user experience

## Conclusion

The IDE-integrated Gemini-Claude architecture represents a significant improvement over the current approach. By using Gemini as the default AI within the IDE and Claude only for specialized reasoning tasks in the cloud, we can maximize token efficiency, reduce latency, and provide a seamless user experience.

This architecture builds on the Gemini-First approach but takes it a step further by integrating Gemini directly into the IDE. This allows for even greater context awareness and more efficient token usage, while still leveraging Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities when needed.
