# Testing the Sequential Thinking MCP Server

To test the sequential thinking MCP server installation, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Restart VSCode and/or Claude Desktop App
The MCP server configuration has been updated for both VSCode and the Claude desktop app. You need to restart these applications for the changes to take effect.

## Step 2: Verify the Server is Running
After restarting, you should see the sequential thinking server listed in the "Connected MCP Servers" section of the system prompt.

## Step 3: Test the Server with a Simple Example
You can test the sequential thinking server by asking Claude to solve a problem using sequential thinking. Here's an example prompt:

```
Use the sequential thinking tool to solve this problem: What is the sum of all integers from 1 to 100?
```

## Step 4: Verify Chain of Thought Functionality
To test the Chain of Thought functionality, you can use a prompt like this:

```
Use the sequential thinking tool with Chain of Thought reasoning to solve this problem: If a train travels at 60 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 2.5 hours?
```

## Expected Results
- The sequential thinking server should process the thoughts and display them in the terminal
- Claude should respond with a step-by-step solution to the problem
- For the Chain of Thought example, you should see explicit reasoning steps, possibly including a hypothesis and verification

If the server is working correctly, you'll see the formatted thoughts in the terminal and Claude will provide a structured solution to the problem.
