# Sequential Thinking Tool Fix - 3/31/2025

## Initial Fix
### Issue
The sequential thinking tool was failing because the compiled JavaScript files were missing from the dist directory.

### Resolution
1. Identified that the MCP server configuration was pointing to `/Users/justincornelius/Downloads/servers/src/sequentialthinking/dist/index.js`
2. Found that the "dist" directory didn't exist because TypeScript files hadn't been compiled
3. Fixed by running:
   ```bash
   cd src/sequentialthinking
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## Context Enhancement Fix
### Issue
The tool was gathering context files and performing web searches for every thought, regardless of necessity.

### Resolution
1. Added `needsTechnicalContext()` method to conditionally gather file/directory context based on thought content
2. Added `needsDeepTechnicalContext()` method to conditionally include code snippets based on thought complexity
3. Updated `gatherRelevantContext()` to first check if technical context is needed

### Technical Context Triggers
Only gathers context when thought contains technical terms like:
- code, file, directory, implementation
- class, method, function
- debug, error, fix, issue
- and similar technical keywords

### Deep Technical Context Triggers
Only includes code snippets when thought:
- Contains terms like: implement, debug, error, bug
- Matches patterns like: "how...work", "fix...bug", "error in"
- Asks about implementation or debugging

## Model Name Fix
### Issue
The tool was potentially using the model name 'anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:online' which might have been causing unexpected behavior.

### Resolution
1. Ensured the model name in `callClaudeAPI` method is set to 'anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet' (removed the ':online' suffix)
2. Fixed a TypeScript error in `index.ts` by providing the `thoughtHistory` argument to `PromptOptimizer.optimizeThought()`
3. Rebuilt the project successfully and verified the tool is functioning correctly

## Current Status
- Tool is now working correctly
- Provides structured thought processing
- Includes evaluation metrics: coherence, relevance, novelty, and actionability
- Successfully generates thoughtful refinement suggestions
- Context gathering is optimized and conditional
- Web search is effectively disabled by using the base Claude model
- Updated metrics to use "enhancementRatio" instead of "compressionRatio" to accurately reflect token expansion due to context enhancement
