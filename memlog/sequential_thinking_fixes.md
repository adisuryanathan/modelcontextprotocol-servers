# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. Error executing MCP tool: "Unknown tool: validate_thinking"
2. Error executing MCP tool: "Unknown tool: list_templates"

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the code, we identified the following issues:

1. The server was missing proper error handling in the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler, which could lead to silent failures when tools are not properly registered or when errors occur during tool execution.

2. The MCP settings file did not include all the available tools in the `autoApprove` list, which is necessary for the tools to be accessible.

## Changes Made

1. Added proper error handling in the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler in `src/sequentialthinking/index.ts`:
   - Added a try/catch block around the tool handling code
   - Added error logging to help diagnose issues
   - Improved error propagation to provide better error messages

2. Updated the MCP settings file to include all available tools in the `autoApprove` list:
   - Added all template tools: `list_templates`, `get_tags`, `get_template`, `create_from_template`, `save_template`, `delete_template`
   - Added all AI tools: `validate_thinking`, `generate_thought`, `get_coaching`

## Testing Results

After making these changes, we successfully tested the following tools:

1. `list_templates` - Returns a list of available templates
2. `get_tags` - Returns a list of all tags used in templates
3. `validate_thinking` - Validates a thinking session
4. `sequentialthinking` - Creates a new thought in a thinking session
5. `get_template` - Returns details of a specific template
6. `create_from_template` - Creates a new session from a template
7. `generate_thought` - Generates a thought based on the current thinking session
8. `get_coaching` - Provides coaching suggestions for improving thinking
9. `get_ai_advice` - Provides AI advice on next steps in the thinking process
10. `save_template` - Saves a custom template
11. `delete_template` - Deletes a custom template

## Conclusion

The issues with the sequential-thinking MCP server have been resolved. All tools are now properly registered and accessible. The server is now functioning correctly and can be used for sequential thinking tasks.

## Future Recommendations

1. Add more comprehensive logging to the server to help diagnose future issues:
   - Log all incoming requests
   - Log all tool registrations
   - Log detailed error information

2. Consider adding unit tests for each tool to ensure they continue to function correctly after future changes.

3. Update the documentation to include information about all available tools and how to use them.
