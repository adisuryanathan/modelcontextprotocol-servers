After testing the Git tools, I can identify a few essential capabilities that would be useful to have:

1. **git_pull** and **git_push** - These are fundamental for collaborating with remote repositories, though I noticed you mentioned in your instructions that we should use the ask_human_tool for these operations.

2. **git_merge** - This would be helpful for merging branches without requiring multiple steps. Right now, there's no direct way to merge our feature branch back into master.

3. **git_rebase** - Useful for maintaining a cleaner project history, especially for feature branches.

4. **git_clone** - For cloning existing repositories, which is often the first step in many workflows.

5. **git_stash** - To temporarily save changes that aren't ready to be committed yet.

6. **git_tag** - For marking specific points in the repository history as important (like releases).

7. **git_blame** - Useful for seeing who modified specific lines of code and when.

8. **git_remote** operations - For managing remote repositories.

9. **git_cherry-pick** - For applying specific commits from one branch to another.

10. **git_fetch** - For downloading objects and refs from a remote repository without merging.

The current set of tools covers the basic local Git operations well, but these additional tools would provide a more complete Git workflow, especially for collaborative projects or more complex repository management.
