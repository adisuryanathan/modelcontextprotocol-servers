# AI Knowledge Server

An advanced MCP server implementation combining knowledge management, sequential thinking, and AI capabilities.

## Overview

This server integrates features from multiple reference implementations:
- SQLite for database operations
- Memory server's knowledge graph capabilities
- Sequential Thinking for problem-solving
- Everything server's comprehensive patterns
