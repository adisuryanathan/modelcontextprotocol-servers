# Sequential Thinking Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential thoughts and chain of thought reasoning.

## Overview

The Sequential Thinking server helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

## Setup

This server requires an API key from OpenRouter to function.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project (where the main `package.json` for the `servers` repository resides).
2.  Add your OpenRouter API key to the `.env` file like this:

    ```
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## Features

- **Sequential Thinking**: Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Flexible Thought Process**: Adjust the number of thoughts as needed, revise previous thoughts, and branch into new paths
- **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Explicitly mark thoughts as part of a Chain of Thought sequence
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Create and test hypotheses as part of the reasoning process
- **Verification**: Verify hypotheses through structured reasoning
- **Persistence**: Save and load thought processes between sessions
- **Multiple Hypotheses**: Support for multiple competing hypotheses with unique identifiers
- **Confidence Levels**: Assign confidence levels (0-100) to hypotheses
- **Branch Merging**: Merge different branches of thought at specific points
- **Chain of Thought Validation**: Automatic validation of Chain of Thought reasoning
- **IDE Context Awareness**: Can optionally receive file structure and open file information from the IDE to inform reasoning.
- **Two-Stage Analysis**: Utilizes Gemini for initial context-aware analysis and pre-reasoning, followed by Claude for final response refinement.

## When to Use

- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out
- When explicit chain of thought reasoning would be beneficial

## Usage

### Regular Sequential Thinking

```javascript
{
  "thought": "This is a regular sequential thought that breaks down a problem.",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}
```

### Chain of Thought Reasoning

```javascript
{
  "thought": "This is a Chain of Thought reasoning step that explicitly follows a structured reasoning process.",
  "thoughtNumber": 2,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "isChainOfThought": true,
  "chainOfThoughtStep": 1,
  "totalChainOfThoughtSteps": 3
}
```

### Hypothesis Generation

```javascript
{
  "thought": "Based on the previous reasoning, I hypothesize that the solution is X because of Y and Z.",
  "thoughtNumber": 3,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "isChainOfThought": true,
  "isHypothesis": true,
  "chainOfThoughtStep": 2,
  "totalChainOfThoughtSteps": 3
}
```

### Hypothesis Verification

```javascript
{
  "thought": "To verify my hypothesis, I'll check if conditions A, B, and C are met. A is true because... B is true because... C is true because... Therefore, my hypothesis is correct.",
  "thoughtNumber": 4,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "isChainOfThought": true,
  "isVerification": true,
  "chainOfThoughtStep": 3,
  "totalChainOfThoughtSteps": 3
}
```

### Conclusion

```javascript
{
  "thought": "After going through the Chain of Thought reasoning process, I can confidently conclude that the answer is X.",
  "thoughtNumber": 5,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false
}
```
