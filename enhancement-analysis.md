# AI Context Awareness Enhancement Analysis

This document analyzes the codebase (`workingMemory.ts`, `embeddings.ts`, `persistence.ts`, `stageProcessors.ts`) to identify opportunities for improving the AI's context awareness within the sequential thinking process.

## 1. Working Memory (`workingMemory.ts`)

*   **Current State:** Stores thoughts with summarized content, full compressed content, and metadata. Retrieval uses embeddings on summaries + recency. Pruning combines age/relevance and LRU.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Basic first/last character summarization loses significant context.
    *   Embeddings calculated on summaries reduce retrieval accuracy.
    *   `metadata.connections` field is unused.
    *   Static configuration (thresholds, weights) may not be universally optimal.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Embed Full Content:** Generate embeddings from the full, decompressed content.
    *   **Smarter Summarization (for Prompts):** Use LLM-based summarization for prompt injection if full content exceeds limits.
    *   **Utilize Connections:** Implement logic to populate and use `metadata.connections` for retrieving related thought chains.
    *   **Adaptive Parameters:** Explore dynamic adjustment of retrieval/pruning parameters.

## 2. Embeddings (`embeddings.ts`)

*   **Current State:** Uses OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (good) or a very basic fallback. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Effectiveness heavily relies on the API key; fallback is weak.
    *   Embeddings are currently generated from summaries (see Working Memory).
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Improve Fallback:** Replace basic fallback with a robust local model (e.g., Sentence Transformers via ONNX) if API independence is needed.
    *   **(See Working Memory):** Ensure embeddings use full content.

## 3. Persistence (`persistence.ts`)

*   **Current State:** Saves/loads entire session state (including working memory) as JSON files in `~/.sequential-thinking/states`.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Provides only session-level persistence; no long-term or cross-session knowledge.
    *   JSON serialization might become inefficient for very large states.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Implement Long-Term Memory:** Integrate a persistent vector store (e.g., ChromaDB, LanceDB) for cross-session knowledge retrieval.
    *   **Optimize Persistence:** Consider more efficient serialization or selective state saving if performance becomes an issue.

## 4. Stage Processing (`stageProcessors.ts`)

*   **Current State:** Determines stage via keywords/modulo. Retrieves memory via basic keyword extraction. Injects truncated summaries (first 150 chars) into prompts.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Context Injection:** Truncating memory items for prompts severely limits the context available to the LLM.
    *   **Retrieval Query:** Basic keyword extraction is suboptimal for relevance.
    *   **Stage Determination:** Rudimentary logic can be inaccurate.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Inject Richer Context:** Include more (or all) decompressed content from memory items in prompts, using LLM summarization if needed for length.
    *   **Smarter Retrieval Queries:** Use embeddings or LLM-based query generation for memory retrieval.
    *   **Improved Stage Logic:** Use LLM classification or embedding similarity for stage determination.
    *   **Dynamic Retrieval:** Adjust the number of retrieved items (`topN`) dynamically.
    *   **Store Evaluation Context:** Add evaluation results to working memory.

## Overall Priority Recommendations:

1.  **Fix Context Injection:** Modify `stageProcessors.ts` to inject richer, decompressed context into prompts. This likely offers the most immediate impact.
2.  **Embed Full Content:** Update `workingMemory.ts` retrieval logic to generate embeddings from full content.
3.  **Implement Long-Term Memory:** Integrate a vector store via `persistence.ts` for cross-session context.
4.  **Refine Retrieval Queries:** Improve query generation in `stageProcessors.ts`.
